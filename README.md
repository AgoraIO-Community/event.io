## Inspiration
Two weeks ago I attended my first hackathon ever at Angelhack Silicon Valley 6/29. I didn't know what I wanted to do so I teamed up with a bunch of random people. We ended up using the Agora.io sdk with some AWS services but we were all unsure on deciding what our final product would be. My team left for the night and I stayed there coding. And  I was watching UFC fight night - Ngannou vs Santos because I missed it that afternoon in the hackathon and what I noticed how some people in the stadium can't see anything because of their terrible seats. Boom it connected like dots. So I scrapped everything we worked on that day and at 3 am in the middle of the night, I started brainstorming and creating the UI for event.io (I guess sleep deprivation gives you visions?).  And two weeks later here I am with the foundation of a  mobile app to improve a user's experience at live events.

## What it does
Improves consumer experience at live events. Provides streaming straight to your mobile device from the venue's cameras.
Check out the video demonstration below!

## How I built it
For quick deployment I created an RDS instance and used API gateway/Lambda to perform CRUD requests. This way I could push out a base product more quickly and focus my time on UI/UX design(my main weakness lol)

## Challenges I ran into
Developing a fullstack application alone is not an easy task. I had to setup the backend, write the front end and also design the UI/UX Design(which I thought was the most difficult). It's an extremely time consuming task thats why usually apps have a whole team working together. I ended up having to hardcode some of the features instead of making it dynamic because I just didn't have enough time.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm very happy with what I built in these past two weeks. I was extremely motivated to finish the basic foundation for this application because I really believe it can be the next big thing. The market is huge for live events and not everyone can afford the best seats in house so there is definitely going to be consumers.

## What's next for event.io
If it were to gain traction, the first thing would definitely be increasing from a one man team. Then we would be finishing all the features for the app, modifying it for scalability, tweak the ui design a bit, network with a real company for its first launch, network some more, and then launching it on the appstore if a company decides to partner up.
